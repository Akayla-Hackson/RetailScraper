This project is a chrome extension that pushes notifications to the user when and where a product becomes available for purchase. Notifications are sent to the email of the user. To start, the user will enter their email, the product they are searching for, and the zip code they are searching in. From there, the Retail Scraper takes over and sends a notification when the product is available and what stores carry the product.
